__[Documentation](http://xsc.github.io/claro/)__ | __[Guides](doc)__

__claro__ is a library that allows you to streamline your data access, providing
powerful optimisations and abstractions along the way.

It is inspired by [muse][muse] and heavily influenced by [GraphQL][graphql].

claro requires Clojure ≥ 1.7.0.

## Features

claro is designed to be flexible and extensible. It'll make your data access
more elegant, efficient and testable, providing things like:

- __batched resolution__ of similar entities,
- automatic __caching__ of already known resolution results,
- __engine middlewares__ to hook into the resolution logic, allowing e.g.
  generic cache or circuit breaker implementations,
- pluggable __resolution strategies__ in the form of `Resolvable` selectors,
- an exchangeable __deferred implementation__, defaulting to
  [manifold][manifold],
- and pre-built middlewares for __data source mocking__, introspection and
  result transformation.

## Quickstart

Data access is defined within records implementing the `Resolvable` interface.
Note that they can always produce more resolvables:

```clojure
(require '[claro.data :as data]
         '[manifold.deferred :as d])

(defrecord Person [id]
  data/Resolvable
  (resolve! [_ env]
    (d/future
      (fetch-person! (:db env) id)))
  data/Transform
  (transform [_ {:keys [friend-ids] :as person}]
    (assoc person :friends (map #(Person. %) friend-ids))))
```

Blindly resolving an infinite tree like this is usually not a good idea – but
claro offers _tree projections_ you can use to describe abstract transformations
of infinite structures:

```clojure
(require '[claro.projection :as projection])

(def person-with-friend-names
  {:id      projection/leaf
   :name    projection/leaf
   :friends [(projection/extract :name)]})
```

And here we go:

```clojure
(require '[claro.engine :as engine])

(engine/run!!
  (-> (->Person 1)
      (projection/apply person-with-friend-names)))
;; => {:id 1, :name "Sherlock Holmes", :friends ["Dr. Watson", "Ms. Hudson"]}
```
