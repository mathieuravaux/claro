(ns claro.runtime.impl
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [loop recur]))

;; ## Rationale
;;
;; The runtime should provide resolution capabilities independent of the
;; actual deferred implementation (manifold, core.async, promises). So,
;; we need to inject the following functionality:
;;
;; - `:deferrable?`: is the value compatible with the deferred impl,
;; - `->deferred`: convert a value to an instance of the deferred impl,
;; - `chain`: add postprocessing to a deferred,
;; - `zip`: concatenate results of multiple deferreds,
;; - `loop-fn`: run's a function as long as it returns a value created by `:recur-fn`,
;; - `recur-fn`: advices `:loop-fn` to continue the loop.
;;
;; This should enable usage of claro with any kind of deferred library, esp.
;; ClojureScript ones, without any further adjustments.
